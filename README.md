# Bank-Marketing-Effectiveness-Prediction-ML-Classification
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict the effectiveness of bank marketing campaigns. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, XGBoost, K Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neaural Networks algorithms are used to build a model to predict whether clients will subscribe to a term deposit or not.
#### <ins>Problem Statement</ins>
     The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).
